\section{Introduction}

\section{Related Work}

\newcite{chomsky:1959:ic} shows that every context-free grammar (CFG) can be
transformed into an equivalent one in Chomsky normal form (CNF).

\newcite{valiant:1975:jcss} proves that parsing CFG into CNF is at
least as fast as Boolean matrix multiplication, i.e., $O(n^{2.81})$.

\newcite{yi:2011:iwpt} speeds up CYP parsing using the parallel
infrastructure provided by modern GPUs.

Some other researchers, e.g., \newcite{ciressan:2001:icfpga}, use
hardware-based approaches, which are orthogonal to this work. 

\newcite{jaffar:2008:aaai} optimizes the memoization of dynamic
programming, and \newcite{chowdhury:soda:2006} optimizes the caching
behavior of dynamic programming.

\cite{hong:2009:tcbb} reuses the dynamic programming results to
speed-up processing a new execution.
